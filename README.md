# Web-Scrape-Challenge

In Part 1, I used an automated browser to visit a website and inspected the page to identify elements to scrape. The elements were scraped using a Beautiful Soup object. The results were stored in a dictionary, and exported to Json and MongoDB.


In Part 2, I scraped a table from a HTML site and stored it in a pandas dataframe. I cleaned the data by changing the data types before analysing the data. Data points where were extracted included the number of months on Mars, the number of days of data. The mean monthly temperature and pressure were extracted, and plotted using matplotlib.
